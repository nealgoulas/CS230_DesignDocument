# CS230_DesignDocument
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client needed to be able to support multiple platforms and handle user authentication. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I laid out the pros and cons of each platform well. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It was helpful to look at along the development to plan next steps. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I dont think there is much I would revise. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I planned recommendations based on the users needs and what I though would work best to meet them.  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the plan based off of previous knowledge. In the future, for a similar project, I would look at what technologies were available and reevaluate what to use based off of
the needs of the user and what was available.
